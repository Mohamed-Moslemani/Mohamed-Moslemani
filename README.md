### About

I am a data scientist and machine learning researcher focusing on computer vision, applied artificial intelligence, and the theoretical foundations of learning systems.  

I currently work as a Technical Consultant at **Quantech SAL**, part of the Midis Group and IBM’s strategic partner in Lebanon, where I design and deploy AI-driven data and business solutions.  

In parallel, I am pursuing a **Master’s degree in Computational Science at the American University of Beirut (AUB)** on a full scholarship. My research explores probabilistic and practical aspects of machine learning, including optimization, model interpretability, and numerical inference in AI systems.  

My professional objective is to connect academic research in artificial intelligence with scalable, production-grade engineering.
